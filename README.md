# Human Activity Recognition

This project implements a human activity recognition system using OpenCV and a pre-trained deep learning model. It processes video input to detect and label human activities in real-time.

## Features

- Real-time activity recognition from video files or webcam
- Customizable input/output settings
- GPU acceleration support
- Display activity labels on frames
- Save output video with labels

## Requirements

- Python 3.x
- NumPy
- argparse
- imutils
- OpenCV

Install the required packages using:
```bash
pip install numpy argparse imutils opencv-python
